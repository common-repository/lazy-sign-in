== Description ==

LAZY SIGN-IN lets you easily create a login and sign-up page for your website. It also offers the required field and unique field verification features. It powers you to add fully customizable AJAX powered responsive signup and login form for your website.

LAZY SIGN-IN lets you create custom sign-up and login form with a single installation. You can easily create sign-up and login page using the shortcode [kwt_ajax_signup_form] and [kwt_ajax_login_form]. It also lets you add the custom fields in the sign-up form. You can add n number of sign-up fields and redirect users to specific page after sign-up from the back-end.

This plugin also auto-generates the username and password for the users who signup. What you have to do is just tick mark the ‘Auto-generate username’ and ‘Auto generate password’ boxes in the signup setting in the backend. It generates fully responsive sign-up page that uses AJAX.

You can add as many fields as you want in the signup form from the plugin settings. The best feature of the plugin is that you can keep the form fields ‘required’ as well as ‘unique’.
